            <h2>About S. Ramanujan</h2>
            <p>
                Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920) was an Indian mathematician who, despite limited formal training in mathematics, made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. His intuitive grasp of mathematical concepts led him to develop novel and highly influential results, some of which were not understood fully until many years later.

            <h2>Mathematical Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ramanujan's work on infinite series, including the Ramanujan series for π.</li>
                <li>The development of the Ramanujan-Hardy number, known for its intriguing properties in number theory.</li>
                <li>Contributions to the theory of modular forms and elliptic functions.</li>
                <li>Ramanujan's work on partition functions, which has influenced modern combinatorics.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                Ramanujan studied at various institutions in India, including the Government College in Kumbakonam, where he excelled in mathematics. His formal education in mathematics was limited, yet his genius was evident through his extensive and original mathematical results. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cambridge University, where he studied under G.H. Hardy, a prominent mathematician who recognized Ramanujan's extraordinary talent.
